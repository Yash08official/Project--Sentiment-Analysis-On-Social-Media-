### <h1> Project : Sentiment Analysis On Social Media (ML Project) </h1>

In this project , I used "Python" language and all the codeing I completed on "Google Colab"

Actual coding I started now,

### <h3> Tasks </h3>




"Assignment 1": Exploring Data with Pandas and Seaborn

Task:
•	Load a dataset using Pandas.
•	Explore the dataset (e.g., check for missing values, data types, summary statistics).
•	Visualize some important features using Seaborn.


"Assignment 2": Implementing Logistic Regression

Task:
•	Load a dataset suitable for classification.
•	Split the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
•	Train a Logistic Regression model on the training data.
•	Evaluate the model using accuracy and F1-score.


"Assignment 3": NLP Task with NLTK

Task:
•	Preprocess a text dataset using NLTK.
•	Perform stemming and lemmatization.
•	Tokenize the text using regexp tokenizer.

"Assignment 4": Text Classification with SVM and TF-IDF  (Do it in Week 3 )

Task:
•	Load a text classification dataset.
•	Preprocess the text data using TF-IDF vectorization.
•	Split the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
•	Train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model on the TF-IDF transformed data.
•	Evaluate the model using accuracy and F1-score.
